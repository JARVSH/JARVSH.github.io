It uses a Speech to Text engine to get commands from user and a Text to Speech engine to give feedback. JARVSH uses natural language processing to answer questions and perform action by delegating requests to different web services like Wikipedia and Wolfram|Alpha. Further functionality can be added to it with ease, and which will be added eventually.\r\n\r\nFor starters, who don't follow iron man you can think of JARVSH like iOS's Siri like system which controls the complete home instead of just the iDevice, and answers all your queries like Siri as well.\r\n\r\nThe code for JARVSH is live at the github repository: https://github.com/JARVSH\r\n\r\n### piSwitch\r\nWe are designing a switch board, which can be replaced with existing switch boards or added as an extension to it. It will be powered by a Raspberry Pi A+, and connected to [JARVSH](https://github.com/JARVSH) through local network. It will take all the commands from JARVSH.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAshutosh Das (@ashutoshdas96)\r\nAsish Panda (@kaichogami)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with implementing JARVSH in your own IOT project?
